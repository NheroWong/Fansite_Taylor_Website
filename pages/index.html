            Taylor Swift has been pretty busy rehearsing for her world tour, but she still has enough time 
            <br/>
            to tease us with what we can expect!In a recent interview, the Style singer gave some insight 
            <br/>
            as to the changes she's making in her upcoming 1989 world tour, explaining that she wanted to 
            <br/>
            flip every decision she's made in previous tours and do the opposite!
            <br/>

            <br/>
            That means different screens, lights, and costume changes! Swifty then dished that the fashion 
            <br/>
            in this show will be less costume-y and more "chic."
